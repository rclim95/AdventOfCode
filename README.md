# Advent of Code

This repository contains my implementation / solutions to some of the problems from
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) hosted by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
:smile: The main repository is split up into the Advent of Code implementation for each year by folders;
check out the underlying folders for more information.

As [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has been my primary editor to implement
Advent of Code, an `advent.code-workspace` Code workspace file is availale in the root of this
repositoryâ€”open this in Visual Studio Code to see the available workspaces for this repository
(separated by years).
